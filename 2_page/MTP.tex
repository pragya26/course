	\begin{itemize}
		\item Objective is to design an efficient map-reduce algorithm for streaming data using the concept of traditional non-streaming map-reduce algorithm in hadoop.
		\item Initial work includes the implementation of existing algorithm in hadoop for efficient analysis of data.
		\item Multi-cluster hadoop setup for data-node and name-node is used for this purpose.
		\item Design and analysis of possible hybrid approach of traditional and streaming map-reduce algorithms.\\[-0.8cm]\\
